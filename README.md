# I started this project but never actually coded anything, so this is highly obsolete

# Graphenlaufen

A project about a little game

The key is a buzzer with a distance sensor that´s connected to my laptop over the serial port (USB)
A little processing program reads the stuff the arduino sends it and plots it to a graph. All packed in a nice cover and here you go!

Made only by myself
